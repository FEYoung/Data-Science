T# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data
Project Getting Cleaning Data

## Project Description
This script is to take the UCI HAR (Human Activity Recognition 
        using smart phones) Dataset and do the following things:

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
    each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data 
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Data
This analysis was to create a tidy data set using the UCI HAR (Human Activity Recognition 
        using smart phones) data.

## Variables and Transformations
All variables and tranformations are detailed in the CodeBook.Rmd with descriptions
of each block of code.  Please refer to the CodeBook file for description of what is 
being done by the R code.

## Source data
The UCI HAR Dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning repository at:
